Note to self: I need to make sure that I am using the correct language in writing about these parameters. I am highly certain that my description of Table 1 is correct (parameters for prior distributions at the highest level). I am least certain that my description of Table 2 is correct (parameters, obtained by marginalizing over hyperparameters). Specifically, I'm not sure whether or not the second clause is right. I am reasonably certain that my description of Table 3 is correct (functions of marginal posterior distributions). The last one could also be functions of parameters.
