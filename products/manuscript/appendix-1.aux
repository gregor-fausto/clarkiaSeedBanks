For each population, the observed germination probability is the obtained from the model for seed bank vital rates. Each point is the population-specific median of the posterior of $g_1$ for a model fit to data from seed bag experiments from 2006--2009. Data was pooled across years. The dotted line indicates a 1:1 relationship between observations and predictions. Values below the line indicate that the model predicts higher germination probabilities than observed; values above the line would indicate that the model predicts lower germination probabilities than observed. \relax }}{8}}
