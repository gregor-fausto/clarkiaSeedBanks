### Measurement questions

Here, I document some questions about the Clarkia demography dataset. I am using the packages `tidyverse` and `readxl` (documentation: https://readxl.tidyverse.org/). 

- [Seedlings and fruiting plant data](#seedlings-and-fruiting-plant-data)
- [Fruits per plant](#fruits-per-plant)
- [Comparison of estimates for fruits per plant](#comparison-of-estimates-for-fruits-per-plant)
- [Fruits per plant data exploration](#fruits-per-plant-data-exploration)
- [Seedling estimates](#seedling-estimates)

### Load packages

Load the libraries for data processing (see https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/issues/669 for the overwrite message I am suppressing)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Seedlings and fruiting plant data

How often are there fewer seedlings counted than fruiting plants, and how might this affect estimates of survival? To address this question, I will explore the distribution of undercounting seedlings. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants<-readRDS("~/Dropbox/dataLibrary/postProcessingData/censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants.RDS")

summary <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(fruitplNumber>seedlingNumber,1,0)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(seedlingNumber)) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(prop = sum(error,na.rm=TRUE)/n())
```

In the observations from `r min(censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants$year)`-`r max(censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants$year)`, `r summary$prop`% of observations exhibit undercounting (i.e. fewer seedlings in a plot in January/February than fruiting plants in June).

One approach to this would be to assume that the survival in these plots is 100%. This would mean setting the number of seedlings in the plots equal to the number of fruiting plants. I plot how the proportion of plots at a population/year corresponds to the estimate of survival if seedling counts are set equal to fruiting plant counts in plots with undercounting. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ratio=fruitplNumber/seedlingNumber) 

# 5% of the dataset has observation errors
summary<-censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(fruitplNumber>seedlingNumber,1,0)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year,transect) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(prop = sum(error,na.rm=TRUE)/n())

summaryTable<-summary %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(prop>0,1,0))

summary <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(seedlingNumber = ifelse(seedlingNumber<fruitplNumber,
                                        fruitplNumber,seedlingNumber)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(y = sum(fruitplNumber,na.rm=TRUE),
                   n = sum(seedlingNumber,na.rm=TRUE)) 

df<-summary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryTable,by=c("site","year")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sigma = y/n)

# the approach of setting seedlings = fruiting plants
# likely means that sites with higher proportion of sites with observation error
# have a higher estimated survival probability
ggplot(df) +
  geom_point(aes(x=prop,y=sigma)) +
  facet_wrap(~site) + 
  ylab("Probability seedling survival to fruiting") +
  xlab("Proportion of plots with undercounting") +
  theme_bw()

```

Another approach would be to discard data from any plots where there are more fruiting plants than seedlings. Broadly, this has the effect of decreasing the estimated probability of survival for plots with higher proportions of undercounting. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary<-censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(fruitplNumber>seedlingNumber,1,0)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(prop = sum(error,na.rm=TRUE)/n())

summaryTable<-summary %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(prop>0,1,0))

summary <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::filter(fruitplNumber<=seedlingNumber) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(y = sum(fruitplNumber,na.rm=TRUE),
                   n = sum(seedlingNumber,na.rm=TRUE)) 

df2<-summary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryTable,by=c("site","year"))

# the approach of setting seedlings = fruiting plants
# means that sites with higher proportion of sites with observation error
# have a higher estimated survival probability
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=df,aes(prop,y/n)) +
    geom_point(data=df2,aes(prop,y/n),col="orange",alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~site)

```

It also seems like there is variation by transect within populations and years. It seems like this might vary by plot along transect; at least for some populations. This makes sense since transects correspond to different parts of the populations. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary<-censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(fruitplNumber>seedlingNumber,1,0)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year,transect) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(prop = sum(error,na.rm=TRUE)/n())

summaryTable<-summary %>%
  dplyr::mutate(error = ifelse(prop>0,1,0))

summary <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(seedlingNumber = ifelse(seedlingNumber<fruitplNumber,
                                        fruitplNumber,seedlingNumber)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year,transect) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(y = sum(fruitplNumber,na.rm=TRUE),
                   n = sum(seedlingNumber,na.rm=TRUE)) 

df<-summary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryTable,by=c("site","year","transect"))

# the approach of setting seedlings = fruiting plants
# means that sites with higher proportion of sites with observation error
# have a higher estimated survival probability
ggplot(df ) +
  geom_line(aes(transect,prop,group=interaction(year,site),color=as.factor(year))) +
  facet_wrap(~site) + ylab("Proportion of plots with undercounting")
```

How much of this is due to sample size? It seems like this is a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. Most of the undercounting happens in plots with few seedlings; the number of fruiting plants tends to be only slightly higher than the observed number of fruiting plants and this effect is most pronounced in 2010, 2011, and 2019.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summaryOriginal <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(n=seedlingNumber,
                y=fruitplNumber) %>%
  # dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  # dplyr::summarise(n=sum(seedlingNumber,na.rm=TRUE),
  #                  y=sum(fruitplNumber,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(p=y/n)

summaryMod <- censusSeedlingsFruitingPlants %>%
  dplyr::mutate(seedlingNumber = ifelse(seedlingNumber<fruitplNumber,
                                        fruitplNumber,seedlingNumber)) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(n=seedlingNumber,
                y=fruitplNumber) %>% 
  # dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  # dplyr::summarise(n=sum(seedlingNumber,na.rm=TRUE),
  #                  y=sum(fruitplNumber,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(p.mod=y/n)

df <-summaryOriginal %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryMod,c("site","year","transect","position")) %>%
  dplyr::select("site","year","transect","position","n.x","y.x","n.y","y.y","p","p.mod") 

#df[is.na(df$p==df$p.mod),]
#df[df$p==df$p.mod,]
error=df[df$p!=df$p.mod&!is.na(df$p!=df$p.mod),]

as.numeric(names(table(error$n.y-error$n.x)))
table(error$n.y-error$n.x)/sum(table(error$n.y-error$n.x))
cumsum(table(error$n.y-error$n.x)/sum(table(error$n.y-error$n.x)))

plot(error$n.x,error$n.y);abline(a=0,b=1)
plot(error$n.x,error$n.y-error$n.x)

ggplot(error) +
  geom_point(aes(x=n.x,y=n.y)) +
  facet_wrap(~site) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0,slope=1)

ggplot(error) +
  geom_point(aes(x=n.x,y=n.y)) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  geom_abline(intercept=0,slope=1)

```


Another solution would be to estimate the true number of seedlings using a model for undercounting, and use that true number of seedlings in the model for survival.


### Comparison of estimates for fruits per plant

I compared the estimates for fruits per plant in the datasets I have to the ones published in the 2011 appendix and the file in the `data and scripts` folder in the Clarkia-LTREB dropbox that summarizes vital rates for a 2017 model. That file is `Clarkia-LTREB\data and scripts\clarkia estimated vital rates and lambdas feb17.xlsx`.

First, I calculated the mean fruits per plant in each year-population combination from 2006-2009. I then averaged these values to get a mean value for each population from 2006-2009. I did this because I assumed this is how the values in Table A2 of the appendix for the 2011 Am Nat paper were obtained. Here's the table:

![Table from 2011 Am Nat appendix.](tablea2.png)
I calculated mean fruits per plant using data from all plots, using data from just the permanent plots, and then added in the data from the table above. The figure below this code chunk compares these 3 estimates. The first column is the estimate from the paper. The second column is the estimate from all plants, the third column is the estimate from the permanent plots. 

```{r}
countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/dataLibrary/postProcessingData/countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots.RDS")

summaryAllPlants<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year<2010) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mu = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean.F.allPlants = mean(mu))

summaryPermanentPlotPlants<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year<2010) %>%
  dplyr::filter(permanentPlot==1) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mu = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean.F.permanentPlotPlants = mean(mu))

sites = 
c("LO","LCW",
  "URS","LCE","CF","DEM","DLW","MC","OKRW","OKRE","FR","BG","BR","KYE","OSR","CP3","EC","S22","GCN","SM")
est = c(9.69,9.09,9.64,9.21,5.24,7.7,6.54,6.96,4.39,4.17,6.29,3.92,3.46,3.78,4.79,5.78,3.4,4.15,4.67,4.09)

app=data.frame(site=sites,mean.F.2011app=est)

summary <- summaryAllPlants %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryPermanentPlotPlants,by="site") %>%
  dplyr::left_join(app,by="site")
summary <- summary %>% dplyr::select(site , mean.F.2011app, mean.F.allPlants, mean.F.permanentPlotPlants)
summary[,2:4]<-signif(summary[,2:4],digits=3)

kable(arrange(summary,desc(mean.F.2011app)), caption="Summary table of fruits per plant")
```

Next, I compared the estimates for fruits per plant to the estimates for `F` in `Clarkia-LTREB\data and scripts\clarkia estimated vital rates and lambdas feb17.xlsx`, which has estimates for each vital rate for each year-population combination from 2006-2015. Here's the relevant part of that file:

![Excel file snippet.](excel.png)

I calculated mean fruits per plant using data from all plots, using data from just the permanent plots, and then added in the data from the Excel file. The figure below this code chunk compares these 3 estimates. The first column is the estimate from the excel file. The second column is the estimate from all plants, the third column is the estimate from the permanent plots. Note that there is not estimate of fruits per plant in permanent plots in the year 2006.

```{r}
summaryAllPlants<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year<2016) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean.F.allPlants = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant))

summaryPermanentPlotPlants<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year<2016) %>%
  dplyr::filter(permanentPlot==1) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean.F.permanentPlotPlants = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)) 

df<-readxl::read_excel(path="~/Dropbox/Clarkia-LTREB/data and scripts/clarkia estimated vital rates and lambdas feb17.xlsx")

df<-janitor::clean_names(df,"lower_camel")

df<-df %>%
  dplyr::select(population,contains("f",ignore.case=FALSE)) %>%  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=contains(c("f")),
               names_to = "variable",
               values_to = "estimate") %>%  
  tidyr::separate(variable,into = c("variable", "year"), "(?<=[a-z])(?=[0-9])") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(year = as.numeric(paste0(20,year))) %>%
  dplyr::select(-variable) %>%
  dplyr::rename(site=population) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(estimate))

df$year <- as.integer(df$year)

summary <- summaryAllPlants %>%
  dplyr::left_join(df,by=c("site","year")) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(summaryPermanentPlotPlants,by=c("site","year"))

summary <- summary %>% dplyr::select(site, year, estimate, mean.F.allPlants, mean.F.permanentPlotPlants)
summary[,3:5]<-signif(summary[,3:5],digits=3)

kable(arrange(summary), caption="Summary table of fruits per plant")
```

### Fruits per plant data exploration

Do plants in permanent plots have more fruits than plants outside of permanent plots? I started thinking about this pattern because I wanted to understand seed rain into plots. Permanent plots may be more likely to be surveyed for all plants, while extra plants are counted ad hoc. This sampling method may bias the 'extra plants' towards plants that are larger, have more fruits, or are more visible. A bias in plant size could matter if seed rain is calculated by using the average number of fruits per plant to estimate plant size in a population-year combination.

I calculated the average number of fruits per plant in permanent plots vs. outside of permanent plots. I did not correct for sampling variation. This first pass suggests that plants censused outside of permanent plots are, on average, larger than those in permanent plots.

```{r}
countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/dataLibrary/postProcessingData/countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots.RDS")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>% group_by(site,year,permanentPlot) %>% dplyr::summarise(mu=mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant))) +
  geom_point(aes(x=year,y=mu,color=as.factor(permanentPlot)),alpha=.5) +
  geom_line(aes(x=year,y=mu,color=as.factor(permanentPlot)),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~site,scale='free') +
  ylab("Mean number fruits per plant") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

I compared the mean number of fruits per plant for the permanent plot data versus the permanent plot plus extra throws data. This comparison is more relevant than the one comparing to permanent vs. non-permanent plots because this is what is used in the analysis.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
position<-read.csv(file="~/Dropbox/projects/clarkiaScripts/data/reshapeData/siteAbiotic.csv",header=TRUE) %>% 
  dplyr::select(site,easting) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(easting=easting/1000)

countFruitsPerPlantJointSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mu.all = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)) 

countFruitsPerPlantPermanentSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(permanentPlot==1) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mu.perm = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)) 

countFruitsPerPlantJointSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantJointSummary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(countFruitsPerPlantPermanentSummary,by=c("site","year")) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=c("mu.all","mu.perm"),names_to = "vars",values_to = "values") %>%
  dplyr::left_join(position,by="site")
```

I plotted the geographic pattern to estimates from plants in (blue) and outside+inside (pink) of permanent plots. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=countFruitsPerPlantJointSummary %>% dplyr::filter(year>2006)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=easting,y=values,color=as.factor(vars)),alpha=.5) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=easting,y=values,color=as.factor(vars)),method='lm',se=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```

I hypothesized that the difference in plant size could be the result of 2 different processes. First, the permanent plots might have a different distribution of fruits per plant than the extra throws. If this were the case (for example) it might be that the permanent plots have smaller plants than the extra throws. Second, the permanent plots might have the same distribution of fruits per plant as the extra throws, but the extra throws might sample more plants and so have a longer tail. In this case, extra throws might also include small plants but also sample the large plant end of the distribution.

To distinguish between these possibilities, I plotted histograms comparing the distribution of plant size for permanent plots and extra throws for each site and year combination (see: fruitsPerPlantComparison.pdf). The plots suggest both patterns. For example, for Borel Road in 2007, the shape of the distributions support process 1: counts in the permanent plots captured small plants that were not counted in the extra throws. Now, for Borel Road in 2012, the shape of the distributions support process 2: counts in permanent and extra plots seem to include a similar distribution of plant sizes, but there are more plants in extra plots and so a longer tail. 

```{r}
siteNames = unique(countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots$site)
plotList <- list()
for(i in 1:20){
plotList[[i]]<-
  ggplot( ) +
    geom_histogram( data = countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year>2006) %>%
  dplyr::filter(site==siteNames[i]) , aes(x=countFruitNumberPerPlant,
              fill=as.factor(permanentPlot)), alpha=.5, position = 'identity',bins=30) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "orange")) +
    geom_vline(data = countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(year>2006) %>%
  dplyr::filter(site==siteNames[i]) %>%
    dplyr::group_by(year,permanentPlot) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(mu = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant)), aes(xintercept = mu, color = as.factor(permanentPlot))) +
      scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "orange")) +
    labs(fill="") +
    theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~year,scales='free') +
  labs(title=siteNames[i])
}

pdf("~/Dropbox/clarkiaSeedBanks/products/figures/fruitsPerPlantComparison.pdf")
for(i in 1:20){
  print(plotList[[i]])
}
dev.off()
```

#### Discrepancy all data vs. subset of data

I also looked at the data on fruits per plant in a different way, plotting just the difference between the full and permanent plot data.

```{r}

jointDiscrepancy<-countFruitsPerPlantJointSummary %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from=c("vars"),values_from=c("values")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(delta = `mu.all`-`mu.perm`)

ggplot(data=jointDiscrepancy %>% dplyr::filter(year>2006)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=easting,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=easting,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```

Next, I looked at whether plots with more plants in extra throw plots vs. permanent plots had a greater difference in plant size. This seems true in some years but not all.

```{r}
countFruitsPerPlantJointNSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n.all = n()) 

countFruitsPerPlantPermanentNSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::filter(permanentPlot==1) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n.perm =n()) 

countFruitsPerPlantJointNSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantJointNSummary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(countFruitsPerPlantPermanentNSummary,by=c("site","year")) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=c("n.all","n.perm"),names_to = "vars",values_to = "values") %>%
  dplyr::left_join(position,by="site")

sampleNSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantJointNSummary %>%
  dplyr::filter(year>2006) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from=c("vars"),values_from=c("values")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(nDelta = `n.all`-`n.perm`)

comparisonN<-jointDiscrepancy %>%
  dplyr::left_join(sampleNSummary,by=c("site","year","easting"))

ggplot(data=comparisonN %>% dplyr::filter(year>2006)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```

I then looked at whether some sites had greater difference in plant size when extra throw plots had more plants.

```{r}
ggplot(data=comparisonN %>% dplyr::filter(year>2006)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~site,scale='free') +
  theme_bw() +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0) 
```

Here we see that generally when there are more extra plots the discrepancy between permanent plot plant size and all plot plant size grows. 

#### Area and discrepancy

I evaluated the hypothesis that the difference would be greatest at sites where the permanent plots cover less of the population. This does not seem to be the case. Instead, there doesn't seem to be a relationship between proportion of the plot covered by permanent plots and the difference.

First, I load in the site abiotic data and calculate the proportion of the site that is covered by the permanent plots. The area data is in hectares (1 ha = 10000 meters squared). There are 30 1$\times$0.5 meter plots at each site. 

```{r}
siteAbioticData <- readRDS("~/Dropbox/dataLibrary/postProcessingData/siteAbioticData.RDS")

plotProp = siteAbioticData %>%
  dplyr::select(site,area,easting) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(areaMeters = area*10000) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(plotsProportion = (30*.5)/areaMeters)
```

I then calculated the difference between the average size of plants outside of permanent plots vs. the average size of plants in permanent plots (`delta`).

```{r}
countFruitsPerPlantAllPlotsSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlots %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site,year,permanentPlot) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mu = mean(countFruitNumberPerPlant),
                   sd = sd(countFruitNumberPerPlant),
                   n = n(),
                   se = sd/n,
                   p = 1/se) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(plotProp,by="site")

deltaSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlotsSummary %>%
  dplyr::filter(year>2006) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(sd,n,se,p)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from=c("permanentPlot"),values_from=c("mu")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(delta = `0`-`1`)

``` 

I hypothesized that there might be a bigger difference between the size of plants in/out of permanent plots at sites where the permanent plots were a smaller fraction of the total site area. Plotting the difference in mean plant size against the proportion of the site taken up by permanent plots, I expected I might find a negative relationship between the difference and proportion of the site taken up by the plots. I did not find this relationship.

```{r}
ggplot(data=deltaSummary) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=plotsProportion,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=plotsProportion,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  ylab("Mean fruits per plant in extra throws \n minus mean fruits per plant in permanent plots") +
  xlab("Proportion of site covered by permanent plots")+
  theme_bw()
```

Here is the discrepancy plotted against easting:

```{r}
ggplot(data=deltaSummary) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=easting,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=easting,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```

Next, I compared the difference in sample size between permanent and extra plots. I took the difference of the number of extra plots and permanent plots. Positive values indicate there were more extra plots. Negative values indicate there were more permanent plots.

I hypothesized that site-year combinations with greater differences in sample size of permanent vs. extra plots might have greater differences in plant size. This doesn't seem to be uniformly true.

```{r}
sampleSummary<-countFruitsPerPlantAllPlotsSummary %>%
  dplyr::filter(year>2006) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(sd,mu,se,p)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from=c("permanentPlot"),values_from=c("n")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(nDelta = `0`-`1`)

comparison<-deltaSummary %>%
  dplyr::left_join(sampleSummary,by=c("site","year","area","easting","areaMeters","plotsProportion"))

ggplot(data=comparison) +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=nDelta,y=delta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```

There is no obvious geographic pattern to difference in sample size either.

```{r}
ggplot(data=comparison) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=easting,y=nDelta),method='lm') +
  geom_point(aes(x=easting,y=nDelta),alpha=.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year,scale='free') +
  theme_bw()
```
